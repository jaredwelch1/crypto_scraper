# Crypto Scraper

Crypto currencies can be traded similar to stocks. Over time, the value
of a particular crypto can fluctuate greatly. This repo is designed to create
a workflow for gathering hourly data about the price of a particular crypto

## To Do

Once a dataset of a decent enough size has been gathered, eventually the plan
is to use LSTM to try to create a deep nueral net which can predict hourly 
changes in value for the future
